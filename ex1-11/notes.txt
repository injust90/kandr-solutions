Ex 1-11 How would you test the word count program? What kinds of input are most likely to uncover bugs if there are any?

Answer: Some kinds of input that are likely to uncover bugs are foreign inputs. However depending on the foreign text,
it is in fact "correctly" counting the letters. Due to the fact that it is counting bytes in ++nc.

Maybe super long inputs that goes past the integer counter will also buffer overflow.

this while loop assigns to c until it reaches EOF
while (c = getchar() != EOF)
	++new character
	if c is newline
		++newline
	if c is space or newline or tab
		state is out of word
	else if state is out of word
		reset state is in word
		add to new word
