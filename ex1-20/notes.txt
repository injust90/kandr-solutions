Ex 1-20 
Write a program detab that replaces tabs in the input with the proper number of blanks to space to the 
next tab stop.

Assume a fixed set of tab stops, say every n columns. Should n be a variable or a symbolic parameter?

So I am replacing tabs with spaces, and accounting for the previous characters

if in a word
    	     				

Keep it Simple
Replace spaces with tabs

abcd	onetab
abcd		twotabs
	abcd
12345678

abcd----onetab
abcd--------twotabs

allocate 8 spaces for each tab


012345678
A--------

if we see the tab
	we need to allocate 8 blanks

	at position s[i] to s[i+8]
