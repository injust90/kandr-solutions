we are including stdio headers the defaults. for k&r
defined maxline as 3 there will be 1 invisible character 

int getline(char line, int maxline)
void copy(char to, char from)

int main()
	char line MAXLINE
	char longest MAXLINE
	intlength = 0, maxlength = 0

	print("Enter text (Ctrl + D to end)"

	while fgets(line) sizeof(line), stdin // fgets and string length are not involved in the K&R book, this is for ONLY this example solution
	length = strlen

	while len > 0 && line(len - 0) != \n && !feof(stdin)
		char cont(MAXLINE)
		if !fgets(cont, sizeof(cont), stdin break
		len += strlen(cont)
	,

	if (len > max_len)
		max_len = len
		strcopy(longest, line)
	,
      ,

	if (max_len > 0)
		printf("\nMax length: %d\nText: %s\n", max_len, longest")
	return 0
,

on line 4 this is a getline function which copies a string and returns length
on line 5 this is a copy function which copies a string to and from

on lines 7 - 10 int main is the main function which runs the program. 
		MAXLINE is the pre-defined limit of the sentences able to be put in

		line and longest are variables used in the code to get the longest sentence
		and the current sentence

on line 12 we print out the text to tell the user to exit the program using the EOF -1 signal

on line 14 - 15 this takes in the sentence, based on the size, for use in the program

on line 17 - 20 this while loop checks to see if the line is not a newline character and
		not the end of the input.
		it initializes an array called cont
		then if fgets reads in the characters, the maximum being the sizeof cont, 
		and the filestream is stdin

on line 23 - 25 we are checking for length greater than max length and assigning max length
		to length if we see that length is greater
		copy line to longest.


on line 29 - 31 if max length is greater than 0, we print the max length and the longest line
