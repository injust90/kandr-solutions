print 1234

set a separate counter, and getline the counter of the longest line seen

while c getchar is not end of file
	count till we see a newline

	compare counter to maxseen

	if max > counter
		getline

	finally, copy.

v2.0

- [X] Fix getline copying the most recently seen text
	
	Possible causes:
	- Count resets, so that it continues to copy the most recent text

while we are going through character by character
	if we see a character, add to count
		
		if count is greater than max
			set max to count
			read the line and return length
	
	I think what is happening is getline is taking in the current line, not the saved line as wanted.

getline
abc

s[0] = a

abcd
abc
abcd
MAXLINE 3
def
