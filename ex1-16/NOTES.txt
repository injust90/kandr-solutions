If we remove the limiter, we segfault

How to handle buffers in nvim?

if characters are past length, then we continue to count. but don't print

loop through the sentence, until you get EOF 


Pseudo-code
12345
12345

Store 12345

If we see 123456
We went past the limit set

So stop copying and keep counting.

One for loop copies until it reaches the end.
while gets the character, and

12345
1234
12345

since the characters are being eaten by getchar, we need to readd them to an array for use in the next for looop

getline()
As we get input, store them in an array for use later to be printed as longest
