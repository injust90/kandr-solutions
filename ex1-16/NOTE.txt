while (there's another line)
	if (it's longer than the previous)
		save it
		save its length
	print longest line


for the length of the limit and c = getchar is not EOF, copy to string

copy from character to string

right now the issue is that it will not copy strings past length of the MAXLINE,
because it is not counting the length of the string
