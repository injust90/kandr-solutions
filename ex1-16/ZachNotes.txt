EOF is a macro, feof is a function.

while fgets is getting the pointer of char array and counting the number of characters, and reading from str

while (get characters from the given file stream and store them in the character array pointed
to by str.
	len = strlen(line);

	while length is greater than zero and line and not equal to newline and check to see if end of the given stream has reached.
	char cont[MAXLINE]

// while you are getting in the sentence, you are setting length to the strlen of the sentence
	// while length is greater than zero and character is not equal to \n, and not EOF
		// set array equal to the pre-established limit
		// if fgets isnot available, break
		// length += length
	// compare to establish longest length
