Ex 1-12 Write a program that inputs its input one word per line.

this while loop checks for EOF until it gets the EOF signal
while c = getchar != EOF
	
	this adds a new character 
	++nc

Input
ABC abc	abc
Output
ABC
abc
abc

this while loop checks for EOF until it gets the EOF signal
while c = getchar != EOF

if c == ' ' || c == '\n' || c == '\t'
	state = OUT;
else if (state == OUT)
	putchar(c);
	putchar('\n');
	state = IN;

if a blank character, state is OUT
when state is OUT
	putchar
	putchar \n
	state = IN
