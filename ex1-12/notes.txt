Ex 1-12 Write a program that inputs its input one word per line.

this while loop checks for EOF until it gets the EOF signal
while c = getchar != EOF
	
	this adds a new character 
	++nc

Input
ABC abc	abc
Output
ABC
abc
abc

this while loop checks for EOF until it gets the EOF signal
while c = getchar != EOF

if c == ' ' || c == '\n' || c == '\t'
	state = OUT;
else if (state == OUT)
	putchar(c);
	putchar('\n');
	state = IN;

if a blank character, state is OUT
when state is OUT
	putchar
	putchar \n
	state = IN


  AB  ABC
 n = 1
 check for letters
 	if we spot a letter
	set state to in
	putchar

else we see a blank
	put newline unless it's the leading because of state

v2.0
check for letters
	if we spot a blank
	set state to out
else we are in a character
	set state to IN
	we put newline once state is set to IN
	putchar(c)

v3.0
check for letters
	if we spot a blank
	set state to out
if state is out
	set back to in
	print newline
if state is in
	print character

v4.0
check for blanks
	if blank state is out
else we are in a word
	set state to IN
if state is IN
	print character

v5.0
loop to check for blanks
if leading characters are blank, do not print

v6.0
we need to check for leading spaces
