- [x] Replace 2 spaces with tabs
- [x] Replace 8 spaces with tabs
- [ ] Shift array by -spaceCount to adjust for new tab insertion

Replace 2 spaces with tabs
count, when we see two spaces. replace that character with *

Run through each character, and if you see a space. Count up to 8 spaces. 
Do not add the character to the array, and shift the array over to the left by the count. 
If we see a non-space character reset the count.

If count is at 8, add a *.
