Ex 1-9 Write a program to copy its input to its output, 
replacing each string of one or more blanks by a single blank.

1	\t	\t2
1	2

1     2
1 2

c = getchar both assigns and gets the character before End of File
while c = getchar EOF

	This checks for newline, blanks, and tabs
	if (c == n)
		++n1	
	
	This puts the character into the stream
	putchar(c)

Problem: We need to only putchar when there is only one blank/space/tab

Solution: Counting the blanks, then only putchar if blanks are 1
By default we putchar, unless newlines,tabs,blanks are greater than zero. then we skip.

If we see a character, then putchar again

if we see tab, add to the tab counter
if tabs are less than 1, put character
then if tabs are
