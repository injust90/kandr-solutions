Ex 1-18 Write a program to remove trailing blanks and tabs from each line of input, and to delete entirely blank lines.

\t\tasdf\t\t
\t\tasdf
***1234***
***1234

Selectively print the output
Hit something other than whitespace exit
Once hit newline, stop

asdf asdf***


if we see a whitespace, put the state as IN
else state is OUT and we can print

so while state is OUT we print and else we do not print

the problem right now is the backtracking where the get_line function has no choice but to continue to progress through
the array.

When the program has trailing spaces it will not print a newline
- Reason being is that it adds a terminating character, so the copy will no longer function

Keep it simple stupid
- [x] First thing's first, we detect the whitespace ' ' or '\t'
- [x] print to s[i] based on whether or not we see whitespace or tab. In other words, do not print whitespace whatsoever
- [x] Do not print trailing 
- [ ] Print leading

IN OUT IN 

for loop in reverse, and removing whitespace

for (int i = len; i > len; --i)
if not whitespace and stateCounter == 1
	to[i] = from[i]

if state = IN
	++i;
