Ex 1-14 Write a program to print a histogram of the frequencies of different characters in its input.

aaa bb cccc d

a: ***
b: **
c: ****
d: *
 : ***

 Two arrays: One that stores the count, and the other stores the character.

 character[0] = 'a';
 count[0] = 3;

 If we see the character 'a', add it to the array at position 0

 character['a'];

character a '97'
increment the character in the position
print out the character

counter[c] += 1

for loop that iterates through the character counter
prints i transposed to character, counter at position i
