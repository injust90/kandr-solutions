// Ex-13 Write a program to print a histogram of the lengths of words in its input. It is easy to draw
// the histogram with the bars horizontal, a vertical orientation is more challenging.

abcd abc
**** ***

while we are reading in the character till EOF
	count first word (i.e. abcd)
	store in an array
	for loop the length of the word in the array
		print *
		print ' '
	
count up till i see a space

v2.0

while we are reading in the character till EOF
	count the word UNTIL we see a space
	
	then change the array number to be counting when we see the space

to print the star
while we are iterating through the array
	print *



abcd abc
*    *
*    *
*    *
*

The issue right now is that the program will not print correctly if we having extra spaces. This is a problem because it does not look formatted correctly.

How do we address this?

ABCD		DEF
****		***
1234		123
     \t    \t    

v3.0

while not EOF
	if IN space
	we are OUT of word

	else
		add to count
		we are IN word
	
	for length of array
		for count k
			putchar
ABC DEFG
3   4

I need the program to print out histograms based on the length of the words input from the line.
However, if the user inputs additional spaces or tabs it is not accounted for.

while getchar is not EOF
	store word in array to be used later
